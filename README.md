Code for "Global relationships in tree functional traits" by Maynard et al, published in Nature Communications, 2022. 

Note that the raw TRY data cannot be used without first filing a TRY data request (https://www.try-db.org/TryWeb/Home.php). The imputed trait data are included in this folder and allow the user to recreate all the figures and analyses in the main text (using files 4, 5, and 6 in the "code/" folder).
