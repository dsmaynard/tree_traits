This repository contains code accompanying the [published manuscript](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-30888-2). 

Note that the raw TRY data cannot be used without first filing a TRY data request (https://www.try-db.org/TryWeb/Home.php). The imputed trait data are included in this folder and allow the user to recreate all the figures and analyses in the main text (using files 4, 5, and 6 in the "code/" folder).
